This repo is a basic assessment of my coding abilities for the Dev10 program through Genesis10.
This repo covers basic uses of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The two "module-assessments" are more developed projects including a website and hangman game.

### Project Description

* **Basic assessment of coding abilities for application to the Dev10 program**
* **Each folder contains the necessary files that should already be linked.  Just download the folders and try running the html files (usually index.html)**
* **This project is meant for graders and Genesis10 recruiters**
* **The goal of this project is to forge a new path for myself as a software developer**
